# Student Portal Demo

This repository contains a basic idea for a student portal application. The aim is to create a centralized platform where students can access various academic resources and manage their educational journey.

## Core Features envisioned:

-   **Dashboard:** A personalized overview for each student, displaying upcoming assignments, announcements, and quick links to frequently used sections.
-   **Course Management:** View enrolled courses, access course materials (lecture notes, readings, videos), and track progress.
-   **Assignment Submission & Grading:** Submit assignments, view grades, and receive feedback from instructors.
-   **Announcements & Notifications:** Receive real-time updates and important announcements from instructors and the administration.
-   **Calendar:** An integrated calendar displaying academic deadlines, class schedules, and important events.
-   **Profile Management:** Students can view and update their personal information and contact details.

## Future Enhancements (Potential):

-   Integration with a learning management system (LMS).
-   Discussion forums or chat functionalities for student collaboration.
-   Resource library with study materials and external links.
-   Career services integration.

This repository serves as a starting point for developing a functional student portal, with potential for expansion and integration of advanced features.
